# POKELMON
A [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) clone with less words and more monsters.

## HOW TO PLAY
You can go [there](https://pokelmon.herokuapp.com) or [there](http://pokelmon.kyuu.site) and go click the buttons.

There are eighteen Pokémon, one for each known type, and each one has exactly one type. You have to guess the team of the day, once per day.

Since Pokemon are not words, you're maybe wondering how to play without randomly guessing each rounds. The answer is: custom rules!

1. There can be duplicates, but not two side-by-side. (e.g. `[Fire, Water, Fire]` is allowed, but `[Fire, Fire, Water]` is not.)
2. A Pokémon will never ever be surrounded by its weaknesses. (e.g. a Pokémon with a Fire type will never be surrounded by a Water & a Rock type). Go study your table!

## CONCLUSION
I'm not sure if this is the best way to play, but it's a good one.
You can submit issues & PR if you feel like it.
